      <h1>Statistics of birds till now! </h1>

      <p>Birds thrive in grasslands, deserts, mountains, forests, tundra and along the oceans’ coasts. But the skies
        have grown more silent in recent decades. Since 1970,we have lost more than 2.9 billion birds,
        according to a study published today in the journal Science. In less than half a century, the avian population
        of the continent has declined by some 29 percent, or more than one in four birds.
        For the first time, researchers found that threatened species aren’t the only birds suffering population loss.
        In fact, common birds—including beloved backyard companions like sparrows and blackbirds—are taking the biggest
        hit.

        The cultural significance of birds is complemented by their ecological importance.
        Birds play vital roles in the health of ecosystems through their actions as
        pollinators, seed dispersers, predators, scavengers, and as prey for other species.
        Hornbills and other fruit-eating birds are critically important in dispersing the
        seeds of many plants, and through this, in sustaining forest health
